Single-memory recall sequences generated by sequence_gen.py
* seq_test.txt is a very short file used for debugging.
* seq_default.txt is a run generated with the default model parameters
* seq_default_2.txt is like seq_default.txt, just with a different seed, but otherwise same parameters
* seq_default_combined.txt is a concatenation of seq_default.txt and seq_default_2.txt
* seq_halfNoise.txt is generated by the default model parameters, except that PARAM_NOISE is halved.
* seq_doubleNoise.txt is generated by the default model parameters, except that PARAM_NOISE is doubled.
